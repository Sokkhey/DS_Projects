# Project Description
In this project, you will work with medical data published in 1986 in "The British Medical Journal" where the effectiveness of two types of kidney stone removal treatments (A - open surgery and B - percutaneous nephrolithotomy) were compared.

You will use multiple logistic regression and visualize model output to help the doctors determine if there is a difference between the two treatments. While not required, it will also help to have some knowledge of inferential statistics.

The dataset used in this project is simulated based on the original medical paper published here.

# Project Tasks
1. A new look at an old research study
2. Recreate the Treatment X Success summary table
3. Bringing stone size into the picture
4. When in doubt, rely on a plot
5. Identify and confirm the lurking variable
6. Remove the confounding effect
7. Visualize model output
8. Generate insights
