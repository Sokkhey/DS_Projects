The raw data files and their format\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_464/img/car_accident.jpg\" alt></p>\n<p>While the rate of fatal road accidents has been decreasing steadily since the 80's, the past ten years have seen a stagnation in this reduction. Coupled with the increase in number of miles driven in the nation, the total number of traffic related-fatalities has now reached a ten year high and is rapidly increasing.</p>\n<p>Per request of the US Department of Transportation, we are currently investigating how to derive a strategy to reduce the incidence of road accidents across the nation. By looking at the demographics of traﬃc accident victims for each US state, we find that there is a lot of variation between states. Now we want to understand if there are patterns in this variation in order to derive suggestions for a policy action plan. In particular, instead of implementing a costly nation-wide plan we want to focus on groups of  states with similar profiles. How can we find such groups in a statistically sound way and communicate the result effectively?</p>\n<p>To accomplish these tasks, we will make use of data wrangling, plotting, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised clustering.</p>\n<p>The data given to us was originally collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
